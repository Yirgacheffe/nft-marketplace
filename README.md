# NFT Marketplace

## What Is a NFT?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like arts, music, in-game items and videos. They are boughtand sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cyptos.

Physical money and cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” meaning they can be traded or exchanged for one another.</br>
They’re also equal in value—one dollar is always worth another dollar; one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin. Crypto’s fungibility makes it a trusted means of conducting transactions on the blockchain.

## Popular NFT Marketplaces

Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are:

- **OpenSea:** This peer-to-peer platform bills itself a purveyor of “rare digital items and collectibles.” To get started, all you need to do is create an account to browse NFT collections.

- **Rarible:** Similar to OpenSea, Rarible is a democratic, open marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. RARI tokens issued on the platform enable holders to weigh in on features like fees and community rules.
